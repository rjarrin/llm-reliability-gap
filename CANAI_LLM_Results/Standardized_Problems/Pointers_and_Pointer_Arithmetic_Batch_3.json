Each bus stop is identified by a unique integer ID, has a human\u2011readable name (max 30 characters), and stores the distance in meters to the next stop on the route. The authority wants a small C program that lets a user **add**, **list**, **search**, and **remove** bus stops while practicing pointer arithmetic and dynamic memory management.\n\n## Requirements  \n\n1. **Data Representation**  \n   * Define a `struct BusStop` that contains:  \n     ```c\n     int id;                 // unique identifier\n     char name[31];          // null\u2011terminated name (max 30 chars)\n     int distanceToNext;    // meters to the next stop\n     ```  \n2. **Dynamic Array**  \n   * The program must store the bus stops in a **dynamically allocated array** that can grow or shrink as stops are added or removed.  \n   * Use pointer arithmetic (not array indexing) to traverse, insert, and delete elements.  \n\n3. **Menu\u2011Driven Interface** (the program must present a menu repeatedly until the user chooses to exit)  \n   * **1 \u2013 Add a new stop** \u2013 Prompt for `id`, `name`, and `distanceToNext`. Insert the new stop at the **end** of the array.  \n   * **2 \u2013 List all stops** \u2013 Print each stop on its own line in the order stored.  \n   * **3 \u2013 Find a stop by ID** \u2013 Prompt for an `id` and display the matching stop\u2019s details. If not found, print \u201cStop not found.\u201d  \n   * **4 \u2013 Delete a stop by ID** \u2013 Prompt for an `id`. Remove the stop from the array, shifting subsequent elements left to fill the gap. If the ID does not exist, print \u201cStop not found.\u201d  \n   * **5 \u2013 EXIT** \u2013 Terminate the program gracefully, freeing any allocated memory.  \n\n4. **Function Requirements**  \n   * Implement a function `void displayStop(const struct BusStop *p);` that prints a single bus stop in the format:  \n     ```\n     ID: <id>, Name: <name>, Distance to next: <distance>m\n     ```  \n   * All other logic (adding, listing, searching, deleting) must be placed in separate helper functions of your choosing, but **no more than three functions** in total besides `main`.  \n\n5. **Error Handling**  \n   * If memory allocation (`malloc`/`realloc`) fails, print \u201cMemory allocation error.\u201d and return to the menu.  \n   * The program should not crash on malformed input; you may assume the user enters integers where integers are expected.  \n\n## Example Input / Output  \n\n```\n--- Bus Stop Manager ---\n1) Add a new stop\n2) List all stops\n3) Find a stop by ID\n4) Delete a stop by ID\n5) EXIT\nChoose an option: 1\nEnter ID: 101\nEnter name: Central Station\nEnter distance to next (m): 850\n\n--- Bus Stop Manager ---\n1) Add a new stop\n2) List all stops\n3) Find a stop by ID\n4) Delete a stop by ID\n5) EXIT\nChoose an option: 1\nEnter ID: 102\nEnter name: Riverside\nEnter distance to next (m): 620\n\n--- Bus Stop Manager ---\n1) Add a new stop\n2) List all stops\n3) Find a stop by ID\n4) Delete a stop by ID\n5) EXIT\nChoose an option: 2\nID: 101, Name: Central Station, Distance to next: 850m\nID: 102, Name: Riverside, Distance to next: 620m\n\n--- Bus Stop Manager ---\n1) Add a new stop\n2) List all stops\n3) Find a stop by ID\n4) Delete a stop by ID\n5) EXIT\nChoose an option: 3\nEnter ID to search: 102\nID: 102, Name: Riverside, Distance to next: 620m\n\n--- Bus Stop Manager ---\n1) Add a new stop\n2) List all stops\n3) Find a stop by ID\n4) Delete a stop by ID\n5) EXIT\nChoose an option: 4\nEnter ID to delete: 101\nStop with ID 101 deleted.\n\n--- Bus Stop Manager ---\n1) Add a new stop\n2) List all stops\n3) Find a stop by ID\n4) Delete a stop by ID\n5) EXIT\nChoose an option: 2\nID: 102, Name: Riverside, Distance to next: 620m\n\n--- Bus Stop Manager ---\n1) Add a new stop\n2) List all stops\n3) Find a stop by ID\n4) Delete a stop by ID\n5) EXIT\nChoose an option: 5\nGoodbye!\n```\n\n## ### CONSTRAINTS  \n\n* **Struct Requirement** \u2013 The primary data entity must be represented with a `struct BusStop`.  \n* **Display Function** \u2013 The details of **ONE** specific bus stop must be printed by a function named `displayStop`.  \n* **Menu Exit** \u2013 Option **5** (or the keyword \u201cEXIT\u201d) must be provided to terminate the program.  \n* **Function Limit** \u2013 Aside from `main`, you may implement **at most three** additional functions.
