No static or global arrays of `Book` may be used to store the catalog.  \n\n3. **Display function** \u2013 The logic for printing the details of **one** specific book must reside in a function with the exact prototype:  \n\n   ```c\n   void displayBook(const Book *b);\n   ```  \n\n   This function must be called both by the \u201cDisplay a book\u201d and \u201cList all books\u201d options.  \n\n4. **Menu requirement** \u2013 The program must present a textual menu as shown in the example. The menu must contain an explicit option to **EXIT** the program; in the example this is option `5`. The exit option must terminate the loop, free all remaining allocated memory, and then end the program.  \n\n5. **Single\u2011source file** \u2013 The entire solution must be written in one `.c` source file. Apart from `main`, you may create additional helper functions (e.g., for adding, removing, searching), but the program must compile with a standard C compiler (C99 or later) without requiring external libraries beyond `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, and `<string.h>`.  \n\n6. **Robustness** \u2013 The program should handle invalid menu choices gracefully by printing \u201cInvalid option, try again.\u201d and re\u2011displaying the menu.  \n\n---  \n\n*Your task is to design the problem statement above; you do **not** need to provide a solution.*", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "iteration": 80}]
