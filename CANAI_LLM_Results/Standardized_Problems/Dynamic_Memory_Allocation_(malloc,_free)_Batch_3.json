The college wants a command\u2011line tool that can store an arbitrary number of student records while the program runs, and release all memory when the user decides to quit. Each student record contains the student\u2019s ID (an integer), full name (a string of up to 50 characters), and GPA (a floating\u2011point number).  \n\nBecause the number of students is not known in advance, you must allocate memory dynamically with `malloc`/`calloc` and free it with `free`. The program will present a simple text menu that lets the user add new students, list all stored students, and look up a single student by ID.\n\n## Requirements  \n\n1. **Data representation**  \n   * Define a `struct Student` that holds the three fields described above.  \n   * The program must keep the student records in a dynamically allocated array that can grow as new students are added.  \n\n2. **Menu** (displayed repeatedly until the user chooses to exit)  \n   1. **Add a student** \u2013 Prompt for ID, name, and GPA, allocate space for a new `Student`, store it, and expand the array as needed.  \n   2. **List all students** \u2013 Print a table of every stored student (ID, name, GPA).  \n   3. **Find a student by ID** \u2013 Ask for an ID, search the array, and display that student\u2019s details (or a \u201cnot found\u201d message).  \n   4. **Exit** \u2013 Free all allocated memory and terminate the program.  \n\n3. **Input validation**  \n   * IDs must be positive integers; if a duplicate ID is entered, print an error and do not add the student.  \n   * GPA must be a number between 0.0 and 4.0 inclusive; otherwise print an error and discard the input.  \n\n4. **Memory management**  \n   * Use `malloc`/`realloc` to grow the array; never allocate a fixed\u2011size array larger than needed.  \n   * Every allocated block must be released with `free` before the program exits.  \n\n5. **User interaction** \u2013 All prompts and messages should be clear and user\u2011friendly.\n\n## Example Interaction  \n\n```\n--- Student Registry ---\n1) Add a student\n2) List all students\n3) Find a student by ID\n4) Exit\nChoose an option: 1\n\nEnter student ID: 1024\nEnter full name: Alice Johnson\nEnter GPA (0.0 - 4.0): 3.7\nStudent added successfully.\n\n--- Student Registry ---\n1) Add a student\n2) List all students\n3) Find a student by ID\n4) Exit\nChoose an option: 1\n\nEnter student ID: 2048\nEnter full name: Bob Smith\nEnter GPA (0.0 - 4.0): 4.1\nError: GPA must be between 0.0 and 4.0.\n\n--- Student Registry ---\n1) Add a student\n2) List all students\n3) Find a student by ID\n4) Exit\nChoose an option: 2\n\nID    Name           GPA\n1024  Alice Johnson  3.70\n\n--- Student Registry ---\n1) Add a student\n2) List all students\n3) Find a student by ID\n4) Exit\nChoose an option: 3\n\nEnter ID to search: 1024\nStudent found:\nID: 1024\nName: Alice Johnson\nGPA: 3.70\n\n--- Student Registry ---\n1) Add a student\n2) List all students\n3) Find a student by ID\n4) Exit\nChoose an option: 4\n\nGoodbye!\n```\n\n## ### CONSTRAINTS  \n\n* **Struct usage** \u2013 The primary data entity must be represented by a `struct Student`.  \n* **Function requirement** \u2013 The logic that displays the details of **one specific student** (used by the \u201cFind a student by ID\u201d option) must be placed in a function named `void displayStudent(const struct Student *s);`.  \n* **Menu exit option** \u2013 The menu must contain an explicit option to **EXIT** the program; in the example it is option `4`.  \n* **Single\u2011responsibility functions** \u2013 Apart from `main`, you may create additional helper functions, but the dynamic\u2011array resizing logic must be isolated in a function called `Student* resizeArray(Student *arr, size_t newSize);`.  \n* **No global variables** \u2013 All data structures must be allocated and passed explicitly; do not use global variables for the student array or its size.  \n\nYour task is to write the complete C program that satisfies all of the above specifications.", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "iteration": 46}, {"text": "# STEP 1: PROBLEM  \n\n## Background  \nYou have been hired to write a small utility for the campus library\u2019s \u201cBook\u2011Swap\u201d program.
