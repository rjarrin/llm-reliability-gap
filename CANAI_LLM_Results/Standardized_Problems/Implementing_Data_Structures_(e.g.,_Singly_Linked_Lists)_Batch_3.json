[{"text": "# STEP 1: PROBLEM  \n\n## Background  \nThe campus library is transitioning from paper\u2011based catalog cards to a simple digital system that runs on a command\u2011line interface. Each book in the collection is represented by a **record** containing its ISBN, title, and the number of copies currently available. Because the library\u2019s collection is constantly changing\u2014books are added, removed, or have their copy counts updated\u2014the data must be stored in a structure that can grow and shrink efficiently.  \n\nYour task is to implement this catalog using a **singly linked list**. The program will allow a librarian to perform basic operations through a text\u2011based menu.\n\n## Requirements  \nWrite a C (or C++) program that provides the following functionality:\n\n1. **Add a new book** to the front of the list.  \n   - Prompt for ISBN (string, up to 13 characters), title (string, up to 100 characters), and copies (non\u2011negative integer).  \n   - If a book with the same ISBN already exists, reject the insertion and display an error message.\n\n2. **Remove a book** given its ISBN.  \n   - Search the list; if the book is found, unlink it and free its memory.  \n   - If the ISBN does not exist, display a \u201cBook not found\u201d message.\n\n3. **Update the copy count** of an existing book.  \n   - Prompt for ISBN and the new copy count.  \n   - If the ISBN is not in the list, display an error.\n\n4. **Display the details of a single book** identified by ISBN.  \n   - The display logic **must** be encapsulated in a function named `displayBook`.\n\n5. **List all books** in the order they appear in the linked list (from head to tail), showing ISBN, title, and copies for each entry.\n\n6. **Exit** the program gracefully, releasing all allocated memory.\n\nThe program should repeatedly present the menu until the user chooses the exit option.\n\n## Example Interaction  \n\n```\n=== Library Catalog Menu ===\n1.

If the ISBN does not exist, print \u201cBook not found.\u201d  \n4. **Display the entire inventory** \u2013 Walk the list from head to tail and print each book on its own line in the format:  \n   `ISBN | Title | Quantity`  \n5. **Update quantity** \u2013 Prompt for an ISBN and a new quantity. If the ISBN exists, replace the stored quantity with the new value; otherwise print \u201cBook not found.\u201d  \n6. **Exit** \u2013 Terminate the program gracefully, releasing all allocated memory.\n\nThe program should repeatedly show the menu until the user selects the exit option.\n\n## Example Interaction  \n\n```\n=== Bookstore Inventory Menu ===\n1.
